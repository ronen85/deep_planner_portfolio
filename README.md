# deep_planner_portfolio

Automated Planning is a field within Artificial Intelligence that deals with composing a
plan based on the problem description. This involves searching in a very large space,
using a heuristic function. As finding a plan is known to be PSPACE-Hard, no single
planner can be expected to work well for all tasks and domains. One approach to
efficiently solve various planning problems is to aggregate multiple planners in a
Portfolio. In this work, we establish a CNN-based model to act as a portfolio and test its
performance which turns out to be have advantages over other approaches.
